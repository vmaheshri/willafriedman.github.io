Ed., Cassella and Berger\nCourse Overview This course will provide some of the mathematical background that you will need to be a successful economist. The topics that we cover in this class will reappear frequently in your graduate coursework, the scholarly papers that you read, and the scholarly papers that you will someday write. The math in the course will be presented at a relatively high level of abstraction – probably much more than you have been exposed to in the past. This may make things difficult, but it is essential since the ultimate goal is to improve your mathematical fluency.\nThe course will be divided into five three week units as follows:\n Math background - techniques of mathematical proof, basic analysis and point-set topology\n A formal introduction to probability\n Random variables and their properties\n Random sampling and estimators\n Hypothesis testing\n  Grading At the end of each unit, there will be an in class quiz. Together, quizzes 1-4 will be worth 60% of your grade, but I will drop your lowest score, i.e., Each be worth 20% of your grade. Quiz 5 will be worth 25% of your grade and cannot be dropped. Because the material in this course builds upon itself, all quizzes will be cumulative, but the emphasis will very clearly be placed on the newest material.\nIn addition to the quizzes, there will be 5 problem sets, each of which is worth 3% of your grade. I encourage you to work on problem sets in groups, but please write up your own solutions independently. Although the problem sets are not worth much, it is NOT in your interest to skip them, as quiz questions may bear a striking resemblance to questions on the problem sets. Please submit them electronically via email to Weonhyeok. After submitting problem sets, he will go over them in Friday section with you.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t regularly schedule office hours because I\u0026rsquo;m pretty widely available. You should feel free to send me an email to schedule a time to come chat for any reason. Weonhyeok is also an invaluable resource, and you should get in touch with him if you want some extra help with something. We are both friendly, approachable and flexible, but it is your responsibility to come talk to us.\nProposed Schedule I will adjust the pace of the course as needed. In general, Friday sections will only be held immediately following problem set submissions, but additional sections may be held if we need to make up a class. The section time is scheduled for Friday 9-10:30,\n• Week 1 (8\u0026frasl;20, 8\u0026frasl;22) - introduction, basic logic, sets, functions, continuity\n• Week 2 (8\u0026frasl;27, 8\u0026frasl;29) - sequences, convergence, contractions (PS1 due)\n• Week 3 (9\u0026frasl;3, 9\u0026frasl;5) - Taylor\u0026rsquo;s theorem, Leibnitz\u0026rsquo; rule, etc. QUIZ 1\n• Week 4 (9\u0026frasl;10, 9\u0026frasl;12) - formal definitions and interpretations of probability, $\\sigma$-algebras.\n• Week 5 (9\u0026frasl;20) - NO CLASS ON TUES/THURS. Makeup class on Friday during section. conditional probability, Bayes rule\n• Week 6 (9\u0026frasl;24, 9\u0026frasl;26) - combinatorics, QUIZ 2 (PS2 due)\n• Week 7 (10\u0026frasl;1, 10\u0026frasl;3) - introduction to random variables and distributions, moments of random variables,\n• Week 8 (10\u0026frasl;8, 10\u0026frasl;10) - moment generating functions, properties of common distributions (PS3 due)\n• Week 9 (10\u0026frasl;15, 10\u0026frasl;17) - common distributions, QUIZ 3\n• Week 10 (10\u0026frasl;22, 10\u0026frasl;24) - multivariate distributions, random samples\n• Week 11 (10\u0026frasl;29, 10\u0026frasl;31) - asymptotic properties of random samples, central limit theorem (PS4 due)\n• Week 12 (11\u0026frasl;5, 11\u0026frasl;7) - moment estimators, maximum likelihood estimators, QUIZ 4\n• Week 13 (11\u0026frasl;12, 11\u0026frasl;14) - bias in estimators, hypothesis testing\n• Week 14 (11\u0026frasl;19, 11\u0026frasl;21) - hypothesis testing (PS5 due)\n• Week 15 (11\u0026frasl;26) - QUIZ 5\nOther Important Information Students with Disabilities: The University of Houston System complies with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, pertaining to the provision of reasonable academic adjustments/auxiliary aids for students with a disability.

The topics of study, broadly defined, will be:\n Social Learning/Norms/Conformity Peer Effects and Identification Sorting (Endogenous Peer Groups) Identity  We will study a number of theoretical models of social phenomena and then pay particular attention to the empirical implications of these models. We will focus on how social interactions between agents confounds causal inference and explore different strategies that researchers have used to circumvent these issues. We will also consider the implications of the structure of peer groups (networks) and how these arise.\nCourse Materials Course materials will largely consist of research papers which will be available here.\nGrading At this point in your studies, you are supposed to be focused on research, so this course will enrich your understanding of others\u0026rsquo; research and will give you an opportunity to develop some of your own. To that end, there will be no exams or problem sets.\nEach student will be required to present 3 well known and relevant papers over the course of the semester. You will have 30-45 minutes to basically “teach” the paper to your classmates. This will be a commitment device for you to master the content in the paper, and it will also foster discussion. You will be expected to participate during your peers\u0026rsquo; presentations with thoughtful questions and comments. Together this will count for one third of your grade.\nThe main focus of this course will be the development of a research proposal that has the potential of turning into a chapter in your dissertation (or perhaps even your job market paper). In total, this research proposal will be worth the remaining two thirds of your grade. Throughout the semester, we will discuss how it should be developing, and there will be explicit opportunities for you to get feedback on your proposal from both myself and your classmates. At the end of the semester, you will present your proposal to the class.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t hold regularly scheduled office hours because I\u0026rsquo;m available pretty much anytime.

To identify impacts, we exploit variation in the timing and location of health worker strikes at individual hospitals across the country between 1995 and 2014. We find that disruptions to care quality during strikes increases both neonatal and infant mortality. In addition, children born during strikes who survive have lower height- and weight-for age z-scores and receive fewer vaccinations in the first year of life. Overall these results show that health care quality can have large immediate health impacts and suggests that these effects persist over time. This study also provides the first rigorous evidence on the consequences of health worker strikes, a growing but understudied phenomenon in Sub-Saharan Africa.","tags":null,"title":"Disruptions to health care quality and early child health outcomes: Evidence from health worker strikes in Kenya","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Willa Friedman","Anthony Keats"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"812b1ddc5b84ef73d37eb56d56dfa2ea","permalink":"/publication/freebirths/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/freebirths/","section":"publication","summary":"Many developing countries have implemented policies to encourage deliveries in formal health facilities to combat maternal and infant mortality. Evidence about their effectiveness remains limited and mixed, raising questions of whether health systems can improve child survival. This paper evaluates a Ghanaian policy that made facility births free using a regression-discontinuity-in-time design, along with difference-in-difference estimates, to measure effects on delivery decisions, health-service take-up, and mortality and health. We find large effects on facility births, particularly for the poorest mothers, which lead to substantial reductions in longer-run child mortality (but no change in neonatal mortality) and improvements in child health.","tags":null,"title":"Institutional Births and Early Child Health: Evidence from Ghana's Free Delivery Policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Willa Friedman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2d4b0ff96601311b66c7272ec514039f","permalink":"/publication/rwanda/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rwanda/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper uses new data on participation to examine how local economic conditions shaped within-country variation in willingness to participate in violent activities during the Rwandan genocide. It discusses and tests the predictions of three sets of theories about the causes of violence. The data provide strong evidence that higher rates of both unemployment and education among Hutu are associated with increased participation. I find no evidence that the employment or education of the Tutsi population reduce participation rates. I also find suggestive evidence of a positive association between violence and the interaction of Hutu unemployment and education both at the commune level and at the individual level. These results are consistent with theories of opportunity costs discouraging violence, and they provide additional evidence of a connection between education, unemployment, and violence.","tags":null,"title":"Local Economic Conditions and Participation in the Rwandan Genocide","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Willa Friedman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8efd70a86b9f3f8a338481585cf44cb0","permalink":"/publication/rwandachapter/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rwandachapter/","section":"publication","summary":"Economic Aspects of Genocides, Other Mass Atrocities, and Their Prevention (2016); edited by Charles H.
